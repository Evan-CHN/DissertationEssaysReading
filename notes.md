# Notes for Dissertation References
## 1. "*Sentimental Analysis: A Combined Approach*"
### keywords: 
1. "what combined?": ruled-based classification, supervised learning and machine learning
   
2. "details":
   1. Rule-based Classifier(RBC)
   2. General Inquirer Based Classifier(GIBC)
   3. Statistics Based Classifier(SBC)
   4. Induction Rule Based Classifier(IRBC)
   5. SVM
   6. Hybrid Classification, e.g., RBC->GIBC, RBC->SBC->SVM...
   
3. "Conclusion"
   1. Hybrid classification is better in some metrics.
   2. Rules reduction -> performance drop

## 2. “*A context-based model for Sentimental Analysis in Twitter*”

1. Aim and Question
Twitter has a wider context information, e.g. the topic and other posts, so the authors use "A Markovian formulation of the Support VectorMachine discriminative model " and get a increment of 20%.

2. Details
Question Background:
Markovian Formulation:
SVM:

3. Conclusion


## 3. "*A neural network based approach for sentiment classification in the blogsphere*"
1. Aim and Question
propose a model: semantic orientation indexes -> neural network
2. Details

3. Conclusion
